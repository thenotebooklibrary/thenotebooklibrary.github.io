    <br><p><span style="font-size: 20px;"><strong>The</strong></span>Notebook opens finally, after going through several changes.
      The Notebook used to be on paper, until it's unfortunate death in 2015, then it re-opened now, with <empasize>two</empasize>workers.
      The two workers are the owner, Lumater, and Stormanubius :), the amateur coder, who will help write articles in this paper.
      <br>The continued Notebook may have challenges, since it takes forever for a single issue to come out, though. But the Owner assures us,
      'the Notebook will have many issues.' Puns. If you got it. <br>So, the Notebook continues...

   <h3 class="article_head">Introducing New Animation</h3>
   <p>Today is the day that I start my job as a journalist for THE NOTEBOOK. Today I am going to do an article that is introducing
   <br> an AWESOME animation called Xanienism! Lumater has been working on the animation for about two weeks and is almost done with it at this point. 
   <br>It is about 4 minutes long and I am very excited about it. KEEP LOOKING AT THE NOTEBOOK FOR MOR ARTICLES! BYE!!</p>
